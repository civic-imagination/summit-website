                  <p>How should we be thinking about new technologies involving Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Machine Learning, and what do we need to know as managers and practitioners to responsibly leverage these opportunities? This session will provide an overview of the current state of these methods and technologies, with case studies of the successes (and missteps!) of governments at the state and local level. We’ll talk about the ways that these technologies can help governments scale their impact, while also getting into the details around the risks of bias, bad data, and algorithmic decision-making.</p>
                  <p>This session is designed for managers and practitioners working at governments and universities, including division managers, data analysts, and subject matter experts.

            <p>Do residents come in for the same processes over and over again? Do people come in missing paperwork that you know is necessary? Are you offering valuable services but are unable to attract interest and attention?</p>
            <p>Writing for residents means moving away from language focused on departments and levels of your bureaucracy to language focused on the daily needs of the residents we serve. We’ll discuss how to organize content outside of your org chart, how to shape communications to be service-oriented, and how to write for accessibility across digital platforms and physical environments.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">You’ll leave with tips and tools that will make it easier for you to write content that uses plain language and is accessible for everyone. Please bring a printed page of existing content or a rough draft that you would like to refine, as we’ll have time at the end of the workshop to incorporate what you learned into your draft.</p>

                  <div class="collapse" id="data-science-executives">
                  <p>How should government leaders be thinking about new technologies involving Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Machine Learning, and what do we need to know to responsibly leverage these opportunities? This session will provide an overview of the current state of these methods and technologies, with case studies of the successes (and missteps) of governments at the state and local level. We’ll talk about the ways that these technologies can help governments scale their impact, while also getting into the details around the risks of bias, bad data, and algorithmic decision-making.</p>
                  <p>This session is designed for department directors, executives, and elected officials.</p>
